Given the global disparities in socio-economic and health conditions, it is crucial to identify and prioritize countries that require the most urgent aid and development assistance. The challenge lies in effectively categorizing countries based on key indicators such as child mortality, income, life expectancy, fertility rates, and GDP per capita. The goal is to identify which countries are in the most critical need of support, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. This analysis aims to provide a data-driven approach to aid prioritization, specifically identifying countries in Cluster 1 as the most vulnerable and in need of immediate intervention.
